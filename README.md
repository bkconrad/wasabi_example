A simple demonstration for the [Wasabi Replication
Library](https://github.com/kaen/wasabi). You move around and shoot circles at
circles, occasionally blowing up.

WASD to move, click to shoot.

To try it, clone the repo, then
run

    npm install .
    node server.js

Then go to http://localhost:8080 in a modern browser (ideally in a couple of tabs, or even with a friend), and enjoy!
