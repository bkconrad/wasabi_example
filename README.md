A simple demonstration for the (Wasabi Replication
Library)[https://github.com/kaen/wasabi]. You move around and shoot circles at
circles.

WASD to move, click to shoot.

To try it, clone the repo, then
run

  npm install .
  node server.js

Then go to `localhost:8080` in a modern browser, and enjoy!
