A simple demonstration for the (Wasabi Replication
Library)[https://github.com/kaen/wasabi]. It makes a bunch of squares

To try it, clone the repo, then
run

  npm install .
  node server.js

Then open `index.html` in a web browser (preferably Chrome). Then open a
few more tabs, and watch the perfectly replicated motion!
